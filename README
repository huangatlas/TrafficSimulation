The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is a time-continuous car-following model for the simulation of freeway and urban traffic. According to this model, we have proposed an algorithm and then an application to simulate traffic on the screen.

We have put 2 synchronised traffic lights on the road, and you will observe how the cars changer their speed automatically according to the distance between them and the traffic light.

This application is developped with C programming language and OpenGL and all the parameters (normal speed, driver reaction time...) can be custumized using the configuration file.

In "Documentation", you can find 3 articals about IDM, and also my final report (LaTex) in French.

We use CodeBlocks as our IDE.
